📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered tool that analyzes EEG data from multiple file formats (CSV, PDF, JPG, PNG, JPEG) to estimate neurotransmitter levels. It compares AI results vs software-based results vs normal levels and visualizes them in easy-to-understand graphs. The system is designed to be fast, accurate, and accessible for both general and disability-friendly use.
